# Heart_disease_prediction
 # Using Feature Selection Method: 
The project focusses on applying different feature selection methods like Filter-based methods, wrapper, Embedded methods and Genetic Algorithms to reduce the high dimensional heart disease dataset and understand how it affects the accuracy of Machine Learning algorithms. 
 # Using Genetic Algorithm: 
We have also explored Genetic algorithm and used it for hyperparameter tuning for two models viz. Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Neural networks to find optimal values of C, gamma and number of neurons, number of hidden layers, learning rate and momentum respectively on different datasets to predict heart disease.
